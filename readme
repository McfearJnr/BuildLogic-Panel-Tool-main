`eeprom.txt`
`lines.txt`
`save1.txt`
`save2.txt`
`BinaryChars.json`

// How to use `1 lines.txt -> eeprom.py`:

Clone this Github Repository.
Ensure python and colorama are installed.

1. Draw a screen design (RGB2 16x16 Panel) inside of `lines.txt`
2. Save design and use `1 lines.txt -> eeprom.py` to turn the design into binary. (Output is in `eeprom.txt`)
3. Copy outputted design from `eeprom.txt` and paste into either `save1.txt` or `save2.txt`.
4. (OPTIONAL) - Repeat steps 1-3, and paste output into the other save file.
5. `Important` - Ensure you have saved both `save1.txt` and `save2.txt`.
6. Use `2 eeprom -> savestring.py` to turn the binary saves into a build logic save string. (Instructions for `2 eeprom -> savestring.py` found below.)

// How to use `2 eeprom -> savestring.py`:

1. Wait for assets to load, then enter `Y` when prompted `16 bit eeprom? y/n`.
2. When asked which file to use for boot (File saved at address 0, other file is saved at address 1) enter either 0 for file1, or 1 for file2.
3. Wait for the script to proccess your files.
4. Once completed, the output will be pasted into your clipboard.
